# Bye Bye Alien 👾🛩️

A 2D space-shooter built with **Phaser 3**, **TypeScript**, **Vite** and **Vitest**.

![Gameplay Screenshot](./bba_screenshot.png)

Pick one of **four ships** on the start screen, then battle waves of
Independence-Day-style alien saucers, dodge asteroid obstacles, grab a
**UFO-disguise power-up** that maxes out all stats for 10 seconds, and survive
long enough to face the **Mothership** boss that appears after 30 seconds.

All graphics are procedurally generated pixel art — no external image assets required.

## Ships

| Ship | Style | Speed | HP | Damage | Fire Rate |
|------|-------|-------|----|--------|-----------|
| **F-35 Lightning** | Balanced all-rounder | 300 | 100 | 10 | 5 /s |
| **Valkyrie** | Fast interceptor, fragile | 420 | 60 | 6 | 9 /s |
| **Titan** | Heavy gunship, slow but devastating | 180 | 200 | 22 | 2.5 /s |
| **Spectre** | Stealth striker, precise long-range | 260 | 80 | 18 | 3.5 /s |

## Power-up

At 20 seconds a **UFO-disguise pickup** drifts across the screen. Grab it to
temporarily transform into a UFO with maxed-out stats (speed 450, damage 30,
fire rate 10 /s, HP 250) for 10 seconds. A HUD bar shows the remaining time.

## Mothership Boss

The **Mothership** appears at 30 seconds (with a 5-second warning).
It slides in from the right and patrols vertically. It fires **aimed
bullets** at the player. Below 50 % HP it switches to a **3-way spread**
pattern. Defeating it scores 2 000 points and wins the game.

## Adding New Ships

1. Add the key to `SHIP_KEYS` and a new entry to `SHIPS` in `src/config/ships.ts`:

```ts
export const SHIP_KEYS = ['f35', 'valkyrie', 'titan', 'spectre', 'raptor'] as const;

export const SHIPS: Record<ShipKey, ShipStats> = {
  // ...existing ships...
  raptor: {
    name: 'F-22 Raptor',
    description: 'Air-superiority fighter. Fast and agile.',
    textureKey: 'raptor',
    bulletTextureKey: 'bullet_raptor',
    speed: 350,
    handling: 1.2,
    damage: 8,
    hp: 80,
    fireRate: 7,
    bulletSpeed: 550,
  },
};
```

2. Add `generateRaptor(scene)` and `generateBulletRaptor(scene)` functions in
   `src/utils/textures.ts`, and call them from `generateTextures()`.
